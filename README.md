# VRExperience

## Controls  
Tested using the Oculus Quest 2 with controllers. It runs a bit slow on the standalone Quest 2, so for the best experience, play it on PC—as it still needs some optimization.

To move the bookshelf and enter the annex, just grab it and slide it like a door.

I created a hiding feature, but since there wasn’t anything to truly hide from, I repurposed it as the ending of the experience and as a sit-down interaction. To sit/hide, approach a specific bench or the bed at the end. To get up from the chair, press **A** on the right controller, then move.

The interactable audio clips are scattered throughout the level and are mostly narrations of pages from Anne Frank’s diary.

To evoke a sense of claustrophobia, I gradually applied post-processing effects like film grain and vignette to impair the player’s vision over time. At the same time, I increased the tension with the constant sound of soldiers marching. Toward the end, the player must pass through an imaginary annex that gradually gets smaller, intensifying the claustrophobic atmosphere.

## Final Thoughts

I wish I had more time to polish this experience. With better voice acting instead of AI and some added animations, I think I could have more effectively captured the feeling of living in permanent hiding with eight other people.  
Originally, I considered leaning more into the educational side of the experience, but since the request focused on a hiding mechanic and a claustrophobic atmosphere, I decided to prioritize that over providing detailed historical information about the house.
